### Progressive Web App (PWA)


This template is **100% PWA ready**.

The ServiceWorker is **disabled by default** and is configured to only work in **production mode**.
Uncomment the line below inside /src/index.html to enable it.

```html
<script>
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    window.addEventListener('load', () => {
      navigator.serviceWorker.register('./sw.js')
    })
  }
</script>
```

You can easily personalize its settings by following these steps:

- Replace both icons in /pwa/icons with your own.
  - One is **512x512** the other **192x192**
- Add your own **favicon.ico** to /src
- Adjust these parameters in the **manifest.json** file in /pwa
  - **short_name**: Max. 12 characters
  - **name**: The full game name
  - **orientation**: "landscape" or "portrait"
  - **background_color**: color of the splash screen
  - **theme_color**: color of the navbar - has to match the theme-color in the index.html file
- You can leave the **sw.js** (serviceWorker) in /pwa how it is.
- Change the **gameName** in /webpack/webpack.common.js

### Native App

The simplest way to build a Native App is using [Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/) and following its [Documentation](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/).
The only thing you need to change after installing Capacitor is the **webDir** inside the **capacitor.config.json** file. Set it to **dist** like so:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.example.app",
  "appName": "YOUR_APP_NAME",
  "bundledWebRuntime": false,
  "webDir": "dist"
}
```

### Custom Configurations

### TypeScript Compiler

Change the TypeScript compiler's settings in the tsconfig.json file.

If you are new to TypeScript, you maybe want to set **"noImplicitAny"** to **false**.

You'll find more information about the TypeScript compiler [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html).

### Typings

You can put your custom type definitions inside typings/**custom.d.ts**.

### Webpack

All webpack configs are in the **webpack** folder.

### Obfuscation

_Obfuscation is disabled by default._

We are using the [webpack-obfuscator](https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/webpack-obfuscator). Change its settings in webpack/webpack.prod.js if needed. All available options are listed [here](https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/javascript-obfuscator#javascript-obfuscator-options).
